## Important Command

        ng new
The Angular CLI makes it easy to create an application that already works, right out of the box. It already follows our best practices!

        ng generate
Generate components, routes, services and pipes with a simple command. The CLI will also create simple test shells for all of these.

        ng serve
Easily test your app locally while developing.

        Test, Lint, Format
Make your code really shine. Run your unittests or your end-to-end tests with the breeze of a command. Execute the official Angular linter and run clang format.
