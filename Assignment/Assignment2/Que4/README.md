## Create angular application which add new component inside root component which will display “Inside Sub Component”.

We have to create the normal angular project. As we want to add new component we can
use below command as
    `ng generate component MarvellousComp`

After this command new folder gets created as MarvellousComp under app folder. which contains
multiple files as .html, .css, .ts. Now we can add desired text in .html file.

As we want to add this component in our root component use its markup as
    `<MarvellousComp-Componet></MarvellousComp-Componet>`
